[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jdbcode/MSScvm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jdbcode/MSScvm)

An automated cloud and cloud shadow masking system for Landsat MSS imagery. It provides a means of more easily incorporating MSS imagery in large-area and time series analysis by providing an efficient way to prevent cloud and cloud shadow pixels from contaminating mosaics, composites, and time series.
